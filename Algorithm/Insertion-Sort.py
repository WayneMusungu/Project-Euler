#It is similar to the way one sort playing cards. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

#The Complexity of Insertion Sort Algorithm
#Suppose, an array is in ascending order, and you want to sort it in decreasing order. In this case, worst case complexity occurs
#Each element has to be compared with each of other elements so, go every nth element, (n-1) number of comparisons are made. O(n2)
