What is a graph?

A graph consists of finite set of Vertices(or nodes) annd a set of Edges which connects a pair of nodes

Why do we need graphs?
They are used to represent networks i.e:
	Telephone network, circuit network, path in a city
Social networks i.e
	LinkedIn, Facebook
Finding the shortest path

Graphs have an advantage over tree data structure because they have a cycle
